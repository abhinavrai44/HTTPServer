# HTTPServer
Implement an HTTP server on a raspberry pi module. The HTTP server is threaded and allows you to access different functionalities such as object tracking, face recognition, etc by accessing different pages.

You need to open (raspberry pi ip)/cam.mjpg on your browser to get access to live video streaming over the local network.

Note - This program has been written using Raspberry Pi camera module. If you use any other webcam then make changes in just the frame capture commands.
